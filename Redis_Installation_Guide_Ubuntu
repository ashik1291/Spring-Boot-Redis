Install and Secure Redis on Ubuntu
The following steps explain how to install Redis on Ubuntu 20.04. You can also use this guide on Ubuntu 18.04.

Apart from installing and setting up the basic configuration, the guide covers how to add password authentication, bind Redis to localhost and rename dangerous commands.

Step 1: Install Redis
Follow the steps outlined below to install and configure Redis on your Ubuntu system.

1. Start by updating the package repository:
	
	sudo apt update
	
2. Then, install Redis with the command:

	sudo apt install redis-server
	
Step 2: Configure Redis
1. Once the installation is complete, modify the Redis configuration file. To do so, open the file with a text editor of your choice (we are using nano):

	sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf

2. Next, find the line specifying the supervised directive. By default, this line is set to no. However, to manage Redis as a service, set the supervised directive to systemd (Ubuntuâ€™s init system).

	supervised systemd instead of supervised no
	
3. Save the changes and close the file.

4. Finally, restart the Redis service by running:

	sudo systemctl restart redis.service

Step 3: Verify Redis Installation
To ensure you have set up Redis correctly, test if the service is running. Also, test the connection to the server, and whether you can set a key-value pair.

Step 3.1: Check Redis Service Status
Check the status of the Redis service by running the command:

	sudo systemctl status redis

The output should display the service is active (and running), as in the image below.
